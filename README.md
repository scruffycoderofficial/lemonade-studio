# lemonade-studio
Ideally, Lemonade Studio is supposed to serve as a UI Node in my stack. Lemonade Studio is a space where I think about embedded broker services. Having separated your nodes to enforce clear concerns at any organizational level, there still will be that gap. How do we bridge it?

## Build Application

``` $ npm run dev

## Run Tests

``` $ node_modules/.bin/mocha ./config.js ./src/LemonadeStudio.test.js
